ML.NET Classification with FastTree
This project demonstrates how to perform a classification task using the FastTree algorithm in ML.NET. The FastTree algorithm is an implementation of gradient-boosted decision trees, which is often used for classification tasks.

Project Overview
This project uses ML.NET, a machine learning framework for .NET developers. The goal is to classify data based on input features using the FastTree model. The dataset used in this project is typically a classification dataset such as the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.
